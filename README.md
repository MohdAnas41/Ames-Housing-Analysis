# Ames Housing Analysis 🏡

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the **Ames Housing Dataset**, performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, feature engineering, and **linear regression modeling** to predict housing prices.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [Ames Housing on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- Contains information on **over 2,900 houses** with 80+ features.

## 🛠️ Steps Covered
1. Data Inspection & Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet)
5. Model Evaluation

## 📊 Key Findings
- Certain **Neighborhoods** significantly impact house prices.
- **Kitchen Quality (KitchenQual)** is a strong predictor of housing prices.
- **Polynomial Regression** slightly improved model performance.

## 💻 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
